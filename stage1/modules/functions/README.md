1. Basic FP notion:		
    - Pure functions	
	- Immutability	
	- Functions as first-class entities	
	- Functions composition	
	- High order functions	
	- Recursion	
	- Currying/Memoization

2. First-Class Functions
    - Arrow functions in ES6
    - Functions as data
    - Functions as objects
    - Passing functions as arguments
    - Returning functions
    - Closure
    - Higher-order functions

## Практика
- Implement private variable
- Anagrams finder in javascript
- Momoization
- Codewars

3. JavaScript: The Functional Parts
    - JavaScript: Functional parts
    - The spread operator
    - Mapping
    - Filtering
    - Every/some
    - Slicing
    - Sorting
    - Reducing
    - Combining functions

## Практика
- Recreate the map function
- Codewars

4. Advanced Functional Concepts
    - Currying and partial application
    - Memoization
    - Recursion
